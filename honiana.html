        <h3>Waiho i te toipoto, kaua i te toiroa</h3>
        <h3>Let us keep close together not wide apart</h3>
        <h3>My name is Honiana White, I am 45 years old and I am a disciple of Jesus Christ. </h3>
        <h3>The relationship I have formed with Jesus is astounding.  He is working in my life in such a profound way that the evidence of the power of God is more tangible than anything else I have ever experienced.  The truth revealed in this is that He is God, He is real, and He has a purpose for my life and yours. I am so impacted by this revelation that I have relinquished my own control and allowed God to direct where my path will lead. I trust Him with my family and all circumstances. Therefore, together with my wahine Maria Wilson-White we have decided to go ‘all in’ for Jesus! We desire to do as much as we can to bring the goodness of God’s Kingdom into the lives of all we encounter. 
        </h3>
        <h3>I once lived a life apart from God, all I had was assumptions about Christianity, not truth. My assumptions were based on my own bias and lack of understanding. It was when I decided to look deeper into Christianity, seeking for myself that I realised there was so much more to Christianity that I did not know. It was also at that point, when I opened myself just a fraction to the possibility of Jesus that my life took a new turn, one freer and more exciting that I could ever have anticipated…
