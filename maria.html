       <h3>Nga mihi, greetings, </h3>
       <h3>My name is Maria Wilson-White and with my husband Honiana White, I am co-founder of Enter Faith Ministries</h3>
      <h3>
        I want to share with you about my greatest relationship. It is not like any other relationship I have ever known. There are no unrealistic expectations placed on me and no circumstances too big to break it. There is no conflict, but only forgiveness. There is trust beyond measure, and the capacity to grow deeper into who I truly am. I do not fear the world around me or the trials it may bring, because this great relationship is secure and steadfast, and holds me tight. Even when I intentionally pull-away, the love I find in the arms of this relationship, never lets me go. Although I may hear the accusations against me and the world around me may remember my mistakes, the voice of love in this relationship offers only compassion, and whispers words of encouragement about my value and worth and reminds me who I truly am.   
      </h3>

    <h3>
      I am a committed to this ministry partnership with my husband Honiana because the greatest experience I have in my life is the experience of a relationship with Jesus. The greatest love I have ever known I found in Him. The greatest freedom, the greatest sense of identity, the greatest understanding of my own self-worth, all found in this relationship with Jesus. 
      </h3>
      <h3>My heart for others is that they find this relationship treasure too. It is not hidden, you do not have to dig deep to find it, nor do you have to do anything. You merely call on the name of Jesus. He is right there waiting. When you call on Him, something amazing will begin to take shape in your life.
      </h3>
      <h3>I invite you to partner with Honiana and I on this journey as we share the living experience of the gospel and see people come to life in Christ Jesus.
      </h3>
      <h3>Aroha nui</h3>
      <h3>Noho ora mai</h3>
